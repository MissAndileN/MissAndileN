    <h2>About Voortrekker Monument</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Voortrekker Monument</strong> is located just south of Pretoria in South Africa. The granite structure is located on a hilltop, and was raised to commemorate the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854.<br>It was designed by the architect <em>Gerard Moerdijk</em>.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Voortrekker Monument</strong> commemorates the epic exodus of disillusioned Boers from the Cape into the interior. This massive monument is ringed with <em>granite ox-wagons, and contains a frieze of Boer heroics</em> inside. The large grounds have been declared a National Nature Reserve, which abounds with small game.</p>
    <h3>Back-Story</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Voortrekker Monument</strong> in Pretoria, South Africa, was built in honor of the Voortrekkersâ€”a group of Dutch settlers (or Afrikaners). The Voortrekkers left the British Cape Colony in the 1830s to found their own colonies in what is now South Africa. Their move is known as the Great Trek.</p>
